      h1 Shifty
      p Shifty has been updated!
      p Shifty now shows more information about shift allocations that Shifty is not happy with.
        |  The tooltip on the staff member's name now shows:
      ul
        li Staff members who usually work the shift but are on leave
        li Staff members who usually work the shift but have a neg
        li Staff members who are working other shifts at the same time
        li Staff members who could work the shift but have a worse score than the person picked (including the reasons why)
      p This should make it easier to work out why a shift has a poor allocation.
